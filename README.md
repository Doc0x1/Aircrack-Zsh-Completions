# Aircrack-Zsh-Completions

Intended for use with Zsh and Oh-My-Zsh as a plugin.

This is a work in progress and the first release, so there may be bugs.

Feel free to report any bugs you find.

## Installation

To install, clone this repository into your custom plugins directory of Oh-My-Zsh. This is usually located at `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/`.

```bash
